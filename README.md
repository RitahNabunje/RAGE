## The RAGE Project  
Regression After Gene Expression

### Aim  
* To explore ways of selecting features from a gene expression study for prediction of a patient characteristic.  
* To investigate the pros and cons of features based on the principal components of the gene expression.  

### Data Source  
The gene expression data comes from,  

**Sayed N, Huang Y, Nguyen K, Krejciova-Rajaniemi Z et al.
An inflammatory aging clock (iAge) based on deep learning tracks multimorbidity, immunosenescence, frailty and cardiovascular aging.
